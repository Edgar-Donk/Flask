==========================================

.. topic:: Purpose

   Shows how to create and control web pages working under a Flask server 
   that powers a dynamic web 
   application, where user actions affect the content.

You need a computor that can either access  
or download Python and Flask programs. Run the programs using the
contents given under examples - it should all work.

By the end you should be able to take part in a quiz on bird songs. This can 
be saved as an executable file and used on computors with no direct access
to Python. Along the way learn to use Flask, how to interact with the sqlite
database and learn to use styling for the web using css. Finally learn to
make the executable file from Python.
