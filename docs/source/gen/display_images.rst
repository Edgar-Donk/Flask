Display Images
==============

Carousel
--------

.. note:: The following is for those writing in Sphinx, not the end user.

If you look up carousel for images, it's likely that someone will state that 
carousel for images is a thoroughly bad idea. There are however a plethora
of various examples on the internet as well as methods for their creation - 
so someone must think they are not so bad afterall.

Unfortunately only only 1 to 2% of the end-users, a fickle class if ever 
there was one,
continue to engage with the sites that use carousels, otherwise it's some
sort of Pavlovian reaction. 

1. See the carousel. 

2. Leave the site.

Truly it's as blunt as that.

Luckily there is a replacement that seems to work, and that is based on
scrolling that immediately reveals the content in a surprising way.
